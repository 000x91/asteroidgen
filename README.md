# asteroidgen

About this mod: 
A Mindusrty mod that provides techs for asteroidgen and other planets those use AsteroidGenerator as their planet generator. Named after AsteroidGenerator.
techs to adapt in the asteroid generator planets where copper is scarce
Expect subpar lead stuffs here. 

This mod is far from complete. Still missing:
-tech unlock for field "drill data mines" where players have to fight a lot of zeniths. 
-mass drivers for other planets that uses AsteroidGenerator.
